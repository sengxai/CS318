            <h2>Why should people get their car oil changed?</h2>

            <p>As many thousands of miles that you put on your car the oil in your car starts to lose it's main purpose. It is to
                lubricate and prevent the car from seizing up. Oil lubicrates all of the internal moving parts within the engine 
                and along with lubricating it keeps the engine cool to a point where the moving parts wont seize up. As time goes by 
                the oil starts to degrade and wont be able to do what it is supposed to do anymore and as a result of no oil changes 
                your car will die and that will cost you a hefty amount of dollar bills. So take the time now to prevent engine failures 
                by changing the oil at regular intervals.
            </p>

            <h2>Why should people change car oil themselves?</h2>

            <p>People should change car oil themselves because it is usually cheaper, peace of mind that it is done correctly,
                 and just to learn a new skill. The only downside is that it may take 30 minutes to an hour of your time 
                depending on the difficulty of how tight an oil filter is and the position of an oil filter. With this mini topic 
                that I chose anyone can change their car oil themselves. <b>Caution:</b> If you're not confident in yourself please take 
                your car to a professional.</p>

                    <img src="images/oilCapRemoved.jpg" alt="Removed the oil cap"></li>
                

                <li>Locate the oil drain plug and put the oil drain pan under then remove the plug with the correct socket or wrench <br>
                    <img src="images/locateFilterAndDrainPlug.png" alt="Locate oil filter and drain plug"></li>
                

                <li>Once oil is all drained, replace the drain plug</li>
                <li>Locate the oil filter and position the drain pan under the oil filter and remove it <br>
                    <p>Tip: If oil filter is stuck use an oil filter wrench to get it off.</p>
                    <img src="images/drainOil.jpg" alt="Draining the oil"></li>
                

                <li>Get the new oil filter and fill it halfway up with new oil <br>
                    <img src="images/newOilFilter.jpg" alt="New oil filter with oil inside"></li>
                

                <li>Replace the oil filter with the new one</li>
                <li>Make sure that the oil filter and oil drain plug are tight</li>
                <li>Jack up the car a tiny bit to remove the jack stands then lower the car</li>
                <li>Within the owners manual you can locate how much oil is needed and pour it into the where the engine oil cap was</li>
                <li>Replace the engine oil cap and check the oil dip stick that the oil is between the two max/min holes/line <br>
                    <p>Tip: If oil is not between the two lines add oil and repeat if necessary. If oil is over the max line/dot by 
                        more than an inch, drain and refill the oil.</p>
                    <img src="images/OilLevel.jpg" alt="Checking the oil level"></li>
                
                <li>Start your car for 5 minutes then turn it off and check the oil again <br>
                    <p>Tip: During this time check if the car is leaking oil anywhere from the bottom. If you do have a leakage the plug or the filter 
                        might not be on tight enough. If oil is spilt on the ground kitty litter can be used to soak up the oil. Use brake cleaner 
                        to wipe any oily surfaces away.</p>
                        <blockquote>"Start vehicle, check for oil pressure and let run for a few minutes. Check under vehicle for leaks. Shutoff vehicle and check oil level again. Record oil change. 
                            Follow the instructions for your vehicle for resetting the oil change light if this feature is installed on your vehicle."</blockquote>
