            <h2>Display Inline-Block</h2>
            <p>Inline-Block elements display in the inline direction, that is 
                in the direction words are displayed in a sentence, so left to 
                right. Inline elements will be next to each other until they run out 
                of space on the line, then they will create a new line.</p>

            <h3>Common Display Inline-Block Elements</h3>
            <h4>Images</h4>

            <img src="images/michaelscott-no.gif" alt="Michael Scott No">
            <img src="images/michaelscott-why.gif" alt="Michael Scott Why">
            <img src="images/michaelscott-toby.gif" alt="Michael Scott Toby">
            
            <p>Images are display inline-block by default that is why they fill space 
                from left to right rather than top to bottom. Also images line up on 
                their baseline or bottom of the image. This can be changed with the 
                CSS property vertical-align.</p>

            <h4>Spans, Phrase Elements & Anchors</h4>
            <span> <a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span">Span</a> is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only 
                use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap 
                your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning. Since it is an 
                inline element it will not create a new element below but next to the 
                previous element. Anchor tags are also inline elements which is why 
                when adding the hyperlink to the word "Span" it did not create a new 
                line of text. The same is true of phrase element tags such as <mark>mark</mark>, 
                <b>bold</b>, and <i>italics</i>.</span>
